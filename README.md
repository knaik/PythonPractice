datas and algo


Editing this from my android phone using termux

first test successful

current setup is using vim for text files and jupyterhub for python notebook

I have git installed on my phone, for potentially getting into blogging again, chromebook for travel or as a primary screen, and a home windows machine when I need to deal with advanced audio codec transcoding and manipulation and to manage my library. (eg. converting from flac to opus , although ffmpeg goes a long, my chromebook is old with little storage and an sd card causes a lot of frction)
