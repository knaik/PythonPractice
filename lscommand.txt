This is a cheatsheet for myself while learning the ls

ls lists all the files in the directory

ls -d only lists information about the current directory. 
the output would be "."  ls -d ~ would give the name of that directory

to filter directories the command s ls -d 

ls -d * lists the same things as ls

add -l like ls -l gives the output in a list form with more details. single column 

ls -d $PWD/* prints the current files with full path name

!!
        ls -d */ gives a list of current directories only
	ls -dl */ gives a list of current directories in lost form
!!
