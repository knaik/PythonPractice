ls -l shows a list
piping with | allows a filter with certain matching

ls -l | ".jpg"

*.jpg wildcard doesn't work 

to do logic such as or you need to use egrep

ls -l | egrep ".jpg|.png"

grep -E works the same 

grep -v does a not operation !!!!!!!!!!

grep and commands are confusing


ls -d */ shows directories. -d just puts ls in directory mode, it does not filter itself 


in directory containing Xodo and Xodo2 and 2Xodo
ls -d Xodo/ would give  only Xodo
ls -d Xodo*/ would give both Xodo and Xodo2
ls -d *Xodo/ would give 2Xodo and Xodo only 
ls -d *Xodo*/ would give all ---- wildcard behaves as expected in this case
